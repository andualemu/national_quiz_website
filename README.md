# My Awesome Blog Website

  I implemented a blog website based on the React and Redux frameworks. The website supports creating, updating, and deleting blog posts. It also supports markdown in the content.

  Extra credit attempted:
  - Handle errors in a graceful way
    Origin of error is reported. For example if an error occurred during updating data, the program tells the user that the error came from updating.
  - Input validation
    The program warns the user if the user attempts to create a post with invalid data - for example empty title.
  - Add a filter posts functionality
    The program supports filtering posts by tag. Posts are filtered as the user types a search term.
